                        <ul>
                            <li>Use dark ink</li><br />
                            <li>Fill in <strong>all</strong> the sections of the form â€“ please do not send a CV as it will not be considered.</li><br />
                            <li>Read the job description and person specification carefully and think how your skills, knowledge and experience match the requirements.</li><br />
                            <li>Show how you meet the requirements marked with an &ldquo;A&rdquo; on the person specification. It may help you to organise your information if you use the requirements as individual headings. </li><br />
                            <li>Fill in your form as fully as possible as we will not be able to make assumptions about your abilities and will not take into account previous applications or previous knowledge about you.&nbsp; </li><br />
                            <li>Make sure that if you say you can do something you give evidence of this on your application form.</li><br />
                            <li>If you have insufficient space then please continue on additional sheets.</li><br />
                            <li>If possible make a copy of your completed form and keep it for future reference.</li><br />
                            <li>Remember that the other requirements not marked with an &ldquo;A&rdquo; on the person specification will be tested elsewhere in the recruitment process e.g. in the interview, by a test, by looking at your documents etc</li><br />
                            <li>Make sure you return the form to us before the closing date, as we don&rsquo;t normally accept late applications.</li><br />
                            <li>Mark the envelope &ldquo;Application Form&rdquo; and post it to Human Resources, Nottinghamshire YMCA, 4 Shakespeare Street, Nottingham, NG1 4FG.</li></ul></div>
